### About Me:

Hello and welcome to my personal website! My name is Oscar and I am a technically proficient individual with skills in programming languages such as Java, Python, and C#, as well as web languages including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also well-versed in server management using Linux (Debian) for Raspberry Pi, as well as database management using SQL. In addition to this, I have experience in setting up networks using OpenWrt, DNS servers, and CDN with ddns.

Aside from my technical skills, I am also proficient in Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access. My typing speed in English is around 50-60 words per minute and in Chinese, it is around 30 words per minute.

I am fluent in both English and Chinese Traditional (Cantonese) and enjoy communicating with people from different cultures. If you'd like to connect with me, feel free to follow me on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook or check out my projects on Github or my videos on Youtube.

Thank you for visiting my website and I hope you find it informative!
